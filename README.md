# Wolfnet Modifier

This repo contains the pages for the Wolfnet Modifier Chrome Extension. If you came here, you are probably looking for the Issues page or are trying to manually install this. If it is the latter, you must first click on the version number, download the zip file, and extract it into a folder. Then you must enable the developer mode in chrome://extensions and hit load unpacked. Select your folder that you extracted to, and you're done.
